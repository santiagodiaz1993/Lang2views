 I

30
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,510
 am

31
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:26,750
 going

32
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:26,830

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:30,720
 we

45
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:30,820

56
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:33,880
 Hopefully

57
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,160
 we

58
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,480

61
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:35,840
 little

62
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,000
 spot

63
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,320
 something

64
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,520
 like

65
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:36,820

66
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,000
 somewhere

67
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,200
 where

68
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,280
 I

69
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,520

81
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,130
 I wonder with

88
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,320
 super

89
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,000
 romantic.

90
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,240
 Look

97
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,680
 life being

 of

217
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,480
 rocks

218
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,400
 here

219
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,480
 at

220
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:43,600
 the

221
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:43,640
 bottom

222
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,160
 and

223
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,280
 it

224
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,330
 is

225
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:44,520
 freezing.

226
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,080
 What am I

227
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,120
 slipping

228
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,120
 everywhere?

229
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,400
 And

230
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,880
 my

231
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,040
 bet you

232
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,440
 just

233
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,480
 cut

234
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:06,680
 out

235
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:06,720
 for

236
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:06,760
 some

237
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:06,880
 reason.

238
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,080
 I

239
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,120
 don't

240
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,160
 know

241
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,400
 why.

242
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:07,800
 I put

243
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,520
 something

244
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
 just

245
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,520
 happened.

246
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,120
 Here

247
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,240
 it is.

248
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,080
 I

249
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,520
 said

250
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:15,720
 I

251
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:15,880
 was

252
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,000
 going

253
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,040
 to

254
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,080
 do

255
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,140
 it

256
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,180
 and

257
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,720
 I

258
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:16,760
 did

259
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:16,960
 it.

260
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,360
 And

261
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,320
 again.

262
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,880
 Let's go.

263
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,920
 Oh,

264
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,280
 fuck.

265
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,520
 So

266
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:47,760
 that

267
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:47,800
 is

268
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:47,840
 way

269
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,480
 cold

270
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:48,560
 and

271
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,000
 unexpected.

272
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,560
 So

273
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,980
 there

274
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,520
 we

275
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,440
 go.
